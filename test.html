					<h1>The old man of the Desert</h1>
					<h3>A Trip to Joshua Tree</h3>
					<p>The Joshua tree, from which the park takes its name, is a spiny yucca mainly found in the western Mojave section. Some guides refer to Joshua tree forests, but forest is hardly a word which comes to mind viewing these sparse old survivors dotted across bare rock in the desert. The plant reputedly took its name after Joshua in the Old Testament, it being likened to an old man standing upright with a spear. Another story is that Mormon pioneers thought the spiny trees were the outstretched arms of Joshua pointing to the Promised Land. Whichever is true the Joshua trees have stood unbowed among the desert rock since the first humans-the Pinto-made this desert their home almost five thousand years ago. While the trekkers and day trippers are uploading holiday snaps safely at home, these spindly survivors sit out every desert extreme. In February and March, some lucky visitors may see the trees send out delicate white “candle” flowers. Then again, they can be elusive and will sometimes skip a year or so before blooming again. The park’s story began 100 million years ago with lava forming bedrock through which water and wind began to carve the twisting geology now seen as a rock climbers paradise. Tough granite outcrops and sheer monoliths offer short climbs at all levels of difficulty, but visitors do not have to clamber up Old Woman Rock or the Giant Marbles to appreciate the strange shapes that that time has carved out of old rectangular blocks. The granite offered a series of rectangular joints eaten away over time first by ground water when lakes and swamps lay in the area, then by heat and wind in the later more arid climate. What remains are sculptured boulders sitting on top of each other in the strangely beautiful piles seen today. The Mojave section of the park, in particular, boasts spectacular geological formations now photographed by hikers happy to simply stand and look. The park was explored by cattlemen in the 1800s who briefly introduced cows to graze on the meagre grassland they could find, though looking out over the desert that is hard to imagine now. In the Mojave section is the preserved ranch house of one settler family, the Keys, who scraped a living for sixty years raising five children in this remote location. These brave pioneers must have had enormous inner strength to survive in this lonely and hard place, but they may also have learned a thing or two from local Indians, who turned the dagger like leaves of the Joshua tree into baskets and sandals, while the flower buds (when they chose to show) and seeds were roasted to eat. A Park archeologist estimated that at least 121 local plant species have been used by the local Indians as either food or medicine in everyday life.</p>
